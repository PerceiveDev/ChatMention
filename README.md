# ChatMention

*ChatMention* is a highly configurable plugin which allows formatting "chat mentions". By default the config is set up to highlight mentions of players names when prefixed with an "@", like @Steve or @Notch.

There is only one command, `/chatmention` which reloads the config (Permission: `ChatMention.reload`).
